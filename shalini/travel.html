                Tourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and
                supporting such travel.The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more 
                generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being
                limited to holiday activity only", as people "travelling to and staying in places 
                outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure
                and not lessthan 24 hours, business and other purposes".Tourism can be domestic 
                (within the traveller's own country)or international, and international tourism 
                has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.</div></p>
